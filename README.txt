Hello!

Enjoy this fun little game I made!
To play, just run PlayGame.html and the game will start on your default browser.

The game was written in HTML5, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.
It is obviously completely open source so if you wanna use, tweak or improve it have a crack at it.

Thanks for playing!
